# Case Study-Facebook

## Product Growth Strategy of Facebook
 

 

- In this case study, let us look at Facebook - the largest social network in the world. 

- The growth of Facebook as a product from inception to now has been nothing short of remarkable. In this case study, we are going to look at facebook's growth across the product lifecycle.  

- Every product goes through 4 stages in its life cycle - Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline.

### Introduction 

- When Facebook was first introduced into the market, it first focused on college graduates as their target users. They adopted the strategy of ‘exclusivity’ by opening only to a few colleges first. Other products to have followed a similar strategy are Gmail which was invited only at first.

 - In their introduction phase, Facebook had a limited number of signups and did not really have a model for generating revenue. And when they came to the market, there weren’t really real leaders in the market and ‘Social networks’ in general were only starting to pick up speed. Competitors were Myspace (USA) and Orkut (India/Brazil). As we can see this fits really well in the Product Life Cycle graph we see above.



### Growth 

- And then, Facebook went into a period of hypergrowth - where people around the world over signed up for Facebook.

**Who are Facebook's target users?**

- Facebook’s core target audience is millennial users, including male and female users. These users are also the largest segment of internet and smartphone users. These users lead the most digital lives and spend a large part of their day on the internet and social media channels. Apart from that, they are also the largest segment of online shoppers. 

- They started introducing Facebook ads and this became their primary source of revenue. With increasing users, their ad sales also increased during the growth phase. Facebook displaced other social networks like Myspace and Orkut in India and became the largest social network in the world.  

- However, there were newer competitors like Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and so on. 

- As we can see, this also fits nicely into the product life cycle graph above.



### Maturity 

- With more than 1.9 billion monthly active users, Facebook has a strong user base. With more people on Facebook than ever before acquiring new users has not been difficult.  

- Facebook has also noted an uptick in mobile users and therefore a lot of investment has gone into developing a great mobile experience for Facebook. 

 

- Facebook can be considered a mature product in a mature market that has not seen any new major competitors since Tiktok. 

 

### Decline 

- Every product and every market eventually declines. Even for Facebook, the first signs of decline are starting to show up.  

- Facebook’s total number of users has declined — a first for the social media platform that has experienced seemingly never-ending growth since it debuted 17 years ago. 

- Facebook lost about half a million global daily users in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the previous quarter, according to the quarterly earnings report of Meta, its parent company. 

- The statistic shows how Meta has struggled to stay relevant to younger users, many of whom are drawn to competing apps like TikTok. 

- That being said the daily active users of Facebook have not seen a drop and are at 1.93 billion total daily active users. So we can certainly not say Facebook is in decline.  

- This is when product teams will look to innovate or pivot into newer markets or business areas to keep the growth active. Facebook's big bet on metaverse seems to be in line with this and only time will tell if Facebook will enter the decline phase of the Product Lifecycle or manage to continue its growth for longer time periods.
